= Pushing an image to a public registry

So far you've been working with your container image locally. Now let's take it to a remote registry.

IMPORTANT: Before continuing you will need to have/create a container registry account. You can sign up for a free one at https://quay.io[Quay.io] or https://hub.docker.com/[Dockerhub]. 

First you'll need to tag your image accordingly to the registry and name you gave to your repository. Eg. if I'm using quay.io and I created a repository 'rhdevelopers'

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
docker tag my-image quay.io/rhdevelopers/my-image
----

Or, if you have a Docker Hub account:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
docker tag my-image docker.io/rhdevelopers/my-image
----

[TIP]
====
If you would like to not use docker.io by default, then prefix the image name with the other registry (Quay.io, for example):

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
docker tag my-image quay.io/rhdevelopers/my-image
----

Also, if you build your image already using the tag, you won't need to do this step before pushing it. In our case it would be like this:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
docker build -t quay.io/myrepository/my-image .
----

====

IMPORTANT: From this point, replace `myrepository` with the name of your own repository.

If you now run `docker images` you'll see something like this:

[.console-output]
[source,text]
----
REPOSITORY                                   TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
my-image                                     latest              a63dec174904        55 minutes ago      516MB
quay.io/myrepository/my-image                        latest              a63dec174904        55 minutes ago      516MB
----

It's now ready to be pushed. Before doing it, you just need to login into your Docker Hub account within your terminal:

[.console-input]  
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
docker login
----

And finally you can push it:

[.console-input]  
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
docker push quay.io/myrepository/my-image
----

You should have an output like this:

[.console-output]
[source,text]
----
The push refers to repository [quay.io/myrepository/my-image]
abea900bc08c: Pushed
99d5cac89a03: Pushed

----

Now if you go to your https://quay.io[Quay.io] or https://hub.docker.com[Docker Hub] account you'll see your image right there.
