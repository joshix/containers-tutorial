== CLI Tools

The following CLI tools are required for running the exercises in this tutorial.

--
Please have them installed and configured before you get started with any of the tutorial chapters.

TIP: You can also use https://podman-desktop.io/[Podman] instead of Docker. The advantage of Podman is that it is 100% Free Open Source and does not need to run with elevated privileges. Just use 'podman' instead of 'docker' throughout the tutorial's instructions, or `alias docker=podman`.
